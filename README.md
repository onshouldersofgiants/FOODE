# FOODE
A C++ program to find both exact and approximate solutions to first order, ordinary differential equations.

This is an exercise in both programming as well as an introduction to DE's course. 
Strategies implemented are the same strategies used when solving DE's by hand. 

Future exploration with this project could examine more computation friendly/efficient approximation strategies of finding solutions.
